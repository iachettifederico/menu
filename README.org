* Xiki Menus

My personal Xiki menus.

Not all of them work, some of them are just tests.

* Welcome
My customized welcome menu with access to what I use more often.

* Devchat
My "development environment hacks" for DevChat.tv.

* Music
A small Xiki music player for Ubuntu (uses =rythmbox-client= to play).

* Browse
Open a url in your default web browser.

* Sudo
Execute linux commands with sudo permissions. It's optimized for ubuntu, but you can probably make it work for any *nix OS.

* Apt
Frontend for =aptitude= on Ubuntu

* Disk
Show disk usage.

* TRecs
My development environment for my =TRecs= project. Also has a player item.
